# AboutMe
A get to know me repository :)

Hello there! My name is Sandy Chan and super interested in data/business analytics. I love collecting data and compiling their findings into reports that can help improve different systems or functions. It means so much to me when I can organize data and use it to reach meaningful conclusions and valuable insights! Though I still have a lot to learn in my field, I can't wait to be able to utilize my skills for storytelling and helping out different people in life!
